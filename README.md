# Photo Auto-Enhance

A local Python tool that auto-corrects photo levels/white balance/contrast using
classical image processing (no ML model, no cloud calls), with optional creative
filter presets on top.

Two ways to use it:

- **Web UI** — upload a photo once, compare visual look previews, and adjust
  intensity, warmth, fade, vignette, and grain without re-uploading. It runs
  entirely on `localhost`; nothing leaves the machine.
- **CLI** — enhance one photo or batch-process a folder.

See [`photo-auto-enhance-spec.md`](photo-auto-enhance-spec.md) for the original design spec, [`PROJECT_REVIEW.md`](PROJECT_REVIEW.md) for the outstanding review backlog, and [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md) / [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for build progress.

## Requirements

- macOS (Intel or Apple Silicon), the currently tested platform
- Python 3.11 or newer; local development is pinned to 3.12 via `.python-version`
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — if you don't have it: `brew install uv`

## Setup

```bash
uv sync --extra web
```

This creates `.venv/`, installs the pinned Python 3.12, and installs all dependencies
(including Flask for the web UI).

## Running the web UI

**Easiest: VS Code Run button.** Open this folder in VS Code, open the Run and Debug
panel (⇧⌘D), select **"Web UI"**, and press the green play button. It starts the
server and opens `http://127.0.0.1:5050` in your browser automatically.

**Or from the terminal:**

```bash
uv run photo-enhance-web
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:5050. Upload a photo once. Choosing a visual look or
moving an adjustment slider reprocesses the already-uploaded image. The server
keeps the last 20 uploaded sessions in memory; restarting it clears them.

Optional vignette and film-grain controls are applied after the chosen filter.
Warmth and matte-fade controls can also fine-tune the color temperature and
black point. All finishing settings update the live preview and downloaded JPEG
and are restored with the rest of the short-lived session state.

The result can also be downloaded as a labeled before/after comparison JPEG.
Each panel is bounded to 2,400 pixels on its longest side so comparison exports
remain practical even for very large source photos.

Web previews are converted to 8-bit JPEG and do not contain source metadata.
Transparent images and images above 8 bits per channel are rejected with an
explanation instead of being silently flattened or down-converted. After
processing, the page shows dimensions, source/output format, active filter, and
processing time, and provides a download link for the currently displayed JPEG.
Photos can be selected with the native file input or dropped onto the upload
area. Results default to a draggable before/after reveal; use its native range
control with touch, pointer, or arrow keys, or switch to the side-by-side view.

Preview images and downloads use short-lived, private in-memory URLs instead of
being embedded as base64 inside JSON responses. The current opaque session ID is
kept in the address bar, so refreshing restores the photo, chosen filter, and
all adjustment settings while the server still holds that session. Results
expire when evicted from the 20-session limit or when the server restarts.

By default the Flask dev server runs with debug off. For local debugging,
set `PHOTO_ENHANCE_DEBUG=1` before starting it.

## Running the CLI

```bash
# Single photo, writes photo_enhanced.jpg next to the original
uv run photo-enhance path/to/photo.jpg

# With a creative preset
uv run photo-enhance path/to/photo.jpg --preset warm_film

# Privacy-sensitive JPEG export: remove EXIF/GPS, ICC, and DPI; choose quality
uv run photo-enhance path/to/photo.jpg --strip-metadata --quality 90

# Batch process a folder, writing to an output folder
uv run photo-enhance path/to/folder --batch -o path/to/output_folder
```

Available presets: `warm_film`, `cool_moody`, `high_contrast_bw`,
`faded_vintage`, `golden_hour`, `teal_ember`, `cross_process`, and
`soft_portrait` (defined as JSON tone curves in
`src/photo_enhance/preset_data/`).

The CLI applies EXIF orientation to the pixels and removes the orientation tag
so viewers cannot rotate the result twice. By default it preserves EXIF
(including GPS), ICC profiles, and DPI where the output format supports them.
Use `--strip-metadata` to remove all three. XMP, comments, thumbnails, and other
container-specific metadata are not guaranteed to survive.

JPEG exports default to quality 92, WebP to quality 90, PNG uses optimized
lossless compression, and TIFF uses LZW compression. `--quality 1-100` is
available for JPEG and WebP outputs.

By default, the CLI refuses to let an output path overwrite its input (single
file, or a batch output folder that resolves to the input folder) — pass
`--overwrite` to allow it explicitly.

## Supported image contract

The enhancement pipeline accepts and returns non-empty NumPy arrays with shape
`(height, width, 3)`, BGR channel order, and `uint8` pixels in the 0–255 range.
JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, and WebP files are supported. Grayscale and CMYK sources
are converted to that contract. Alpha/transparency and images above 8 bits per
channel are currently rejected because accepting them would silently discard
data. RAW files remain out of scope.

## Running tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

## macOS setup notes

- `opencv-python` and `Pillow` both ship prebuilt wheels for `arm64` and `x86_64`
  Macs — `uv sync` just works, no compiling.
- Project is pinned to Python 3.12 (not the newest 3.14) specifically because
  `opencv-python` wheel coverage for very new Python versions can lag behind —
  3.12 is the safe, well-supported choice.
- **RAW support (stretch goal, not yet implemented):** if `rawpy` gets added later,
  it wraps `libraw`, which on Apple Silicon sometimes needs to be installed via
  Homebrew first (`brew install libraw`) before `pip install rawpy` behaves
  correctly. Do this before adding the dependency, not after hitting a build error.

## Project boundaries

Photo Enhance stays local: no cloud processing, user accounts, or required ML
model dependency. Larger optional capabilities—including RAW support,
Real-ESRGAN integration, and `.cube` LUT files—remain tracked as possible future
work in [TASKS.md](TASKS.md).
